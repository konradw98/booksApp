### Spring 
Spring is the most popular application development framework for enterprise Java. Millions of developers around the world use Spring Framework to create high performing, easily testable, and reusable code.
### Design paterns
* Dependency Injection (DI) - One of the main design patterns in Spring. The class is independent of any particular implementation. This makes it configurable by the client, which promotes reusability and maintainability.
* Model-View-Controller -  helps you create applications that separate the different aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements.
